# **Pricosha**

###**Project Description**
PriCoSha is a system of privately sharing content items among groups of people. PriCoSha gives users somewhat more privacy than many content sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which content items they post and more control over whether other people can tag content items with a userâ€™s personal information. Users are able to log in, post and view content items posted by others, and tag content items with emails of people referred to in the content items if given permission. PriCoSha was created using Flask and MySQL and using pymysql to connect to the database.
